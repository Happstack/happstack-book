Serving Files from Disk
=======================

Happstack can be used to serve static files from disk, such as `.html`, `.jpg`, etc.

The file serving capabilities can be divided into two categories:


 1. Serving files from a directory based on a direct mapping of a portion of the URI to file names on the disk
 2. Serving an specific, individual file on disk, whose name may be different from the URI
